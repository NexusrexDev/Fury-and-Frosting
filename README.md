# Fury and Frosting
A 2D platformer with auto-runner mechanics, where the player runs immediately and if they stand still, they lose health points.
This was a submission for SAIL for Change's [Gaming Academy](https://twitter.com/gamedevsmena) 4.0, and an attempt to use C# with Godot Engine 4.
Visuals are made using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) and the music is made with Ableton and [William Kage's soundfonts](https://www.williamkage.com/snes_soundfonts/).
